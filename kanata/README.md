# Kanata keyboard definition

Files in this directory are not part or needed for ZMK, they are [Kanata]
keyboard definition files.

[Kanata] is a cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and
Windows. The attached [Kanata] configuration file `./qwerty-home-row-mods.kbd`
simulates the same behavior as the Totem ZMK keyboard in this repository,
but for regular (built-in) QWERTY keyboards.
